# Employee-Attrition-Project
Any company wants to understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover and thus I create this model that can predict if a certain employee will leave the company or not. The goal is to create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees. Overall, the implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.
