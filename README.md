## Objective:
Any company wants to understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover and thus I create this model that can predict if a certain employee will leave the company or not. The goal is to create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees. Overall, the implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.

## OSEMN Pipeline:
I’ll be following a typical data science pipeline, which is call “OSEMN”-

1.) Obtaining the data is the first approach in solving the problem.

2.) Scrubbing or cleaning the data is the next step. This includes data imputation of missing or invalid data and fixing column names.

3.) Exploring the data will follow right after and allow further insight of what our dataset contains. Looking for any outliers or weird data. Understanding the relationship each explanatory variable has with the response variable resides here and we can do this with a correlation matrix.

4.) Modeling the data will give us our predictive power.

5.) INterpreting the data is last. With all the results and analysis of the data, what conclusion is made? What factors contributed most to employee turnover? What relationship of variables were found?
## Conclusion:
With all of this information, this is why employees probably left:

1.) Employees generally left when they are underworked (less than 150hr/month or 6hr/day)

2.) Employees generally left when they are overworked (more than 250hr/month or 10hr/day)

3.) Employees with either really high or low evaluations should be taken into consideration for high turnover rate

4.) Employees with low to medium salaries are the bulk of employee turnover

5.) Employees that had 2,6, or 7 project count was at risk of leaving the company

6.) Employee satisfaction is the highest indicator for employee turnover.

7.) Employee that had 4 and 5 yearsAtCompany should be taken into consideration for high turnover rate

8.) Employee satisfaction, yearsAtCompany, and evaluation were the three biggest factors in determining turnover.
